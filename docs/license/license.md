# License

The p2p Shipyard is currently [Source-Available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software), and once our retroactive crowdfunding goal is reached, it will be [Free and Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), Forever.

Until then, you just have to reach out to us to work out a contribution towards the retroactive crowdfunding goal in exchange for a license to use it. We’re committed to making it accessible, so don’t hesitate to reach out.

Once the retroactive crowdfunding goal is met, no one will ever have to ask anyone to use it again. 

If you need support for integration, bug fixes, or feature requests for the p2p Shipyard, we will be offering [support tickets here](https://opencollective.com/darksoil/projects/p2pshipyard).
