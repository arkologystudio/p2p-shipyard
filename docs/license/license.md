The basic cost of an engagement is 1 ticket. darksoil studio reserves the right to define when an engagement becomes more than a single ticket and how many tickets that engagement requires. darksoil studio will tell you how many tickets we think something’s going to take, and we won’t move forward with something if it needs a new ticket without your permission.
