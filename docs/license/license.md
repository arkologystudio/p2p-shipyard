Once the goal of the tier "Open-Source it!" is reached, we'll add the Open-Source license to the repository so that everyone can use it, for free.

If you want to use the tauri plugin holochain module before it becomes Open Source, please reach out to us to setup a licensing agreement.

# Support

You can buy support tickets that can be used for bug fixes and feature requests on our software, and for coaching for support and integration.

The basic cost of an engagement is 1 ticket. darksoil studio reserves the right to define when an engagement becomes more than a single ticket and how many tickets that engagement requires. darksoil studio will tell you how many tickets we think something’s going to take, and we won’t move forward with something if it needs a new ticket without your permission.
