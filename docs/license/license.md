# License

We’re using a retroactive crowdfunding mechanism to fund the `p2p-shipyard`.

The `p2p-shipyard` is currently Source-Available, and once the retroactive crowdfunding goal is reached, it will be Free and Open Source, Forever. 

Up until the retroactive crowdfunding goal is reached, you just have to ask us to use it, and then we’ll work out a contribution to the open source goal together to give you a license to use it.

Once the retroactive crowdfunding goal is met, no one will have to ask anyone to use it ever again. 

### The Plan

#### Phase 1 – Build p2p Shipyard		

* Make the thing (DONE*)

#### Phase 2 – Fund		

* Retroactive Crowdfunding 
  * Contributions through the [darksoil Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/darksoil/projects/p2p-shipyard)
  * Contributions of HOT, ETH (link to wallet addresses here)
* License fees
  * All license fees go towards the Open-Sourcing goal

#### Phase 3 – Maintenance

* Offer Support Tickets for maintenance, integration, and coaching
* Possibly create a recurring monthly maintenance goal

*except it’s software so it will never be 100% done :)

# Support

You can buy support tickets that can be used for bug fixes and feature requests on our software, and for coaching for support and integration.

The basic cost of an engagement is 1 ticket. darksoil studio reserves the right to define when an engagement becomes more than a single ticket and how many tickets that engagement requires. darksoil studio will tell you how many tickets we think something’s going to take, and we won’t move forward with something if it needs a new ticket without your permission. 

To buy a ticket, go to our open collective page:
